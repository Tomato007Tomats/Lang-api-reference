Welcome to the LangGraph reference docs!

These pages detail the core interfaces you will use when building with LangGraph. Each section covers a different part of the ecosystem.

## `langgraph` ¶

The core APIs for the LangGraph open source library.

- Graphs: Main graph abstraction and usage.
- Functional API: Functional programming interface for graphs.
- Pregel: Pregel-inspired computation model.
- Checkpointing: Saving and restoring graph state.
- Storage: Storage backends and options.
- Caching: Caching mechanisms for performance.
- Types: Type definitions for graph components.
- Runtime: Runtime configuration and options.
- Config: Configuration options.
- Errors: Error types and handling.
- Constants: Global constants.
- Channels: Message passing and channels.

Model Context Protocol (MCP) support

To use MCP tools in your LangGraph application, check out `langchain-mcp-adapters`.

## Prebuilt components ¶

Higher-level abstractions for common workflows, agents, and other patterns.

- Agents: Built-in agent patterns.
- Supervisor: Orchestration and delegation.
- Swarm: Multi-agent collaboration.
